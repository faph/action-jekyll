# A GitHub Action for just building Jekyll web sites

We're only building the site here. If you want to do some other stuff with those
site files like deploying them, or running some build scripts on them—you'll
have to connect up some other actions to your workflow.


## Inputs

- `destination_dir`: Optional. Jekyll destination directory. Default: `_site`,
  directory within the checked out repository.
- `source_dir`: Optional. Jekyll source directory. Defaults to the whole repository.
- `add_nojekyll_tag`: Optional. Whether to add a .nojekyll file to the
  destination directory to prevent GitHub building the website with Jekyll.
  Default: `true`.


## Examples

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build website
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v1
      with:
        ref: master
    - name: Run Jekyll
      uses: docker://faph/action-jekyll:1.5
```

Clones the repo and builds the site—that's it.


## Caveats

* Needs a Gemfile in the source directory.
* Be sure that any custom gems needed are included in your Gemfile.
